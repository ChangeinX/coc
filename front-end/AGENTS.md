# Front-end Guidelines

This directory contains the React dashboard built with Vite.

- Place small reusable components in `src/components/`.
- Larger pages should live under `src/pages/`.
- Shared utilities belong in `src/lib/`.
- Update import paths to match this structure when adding new code.
- Before submitting a pull request run `npm install` and `npm run build` to ensure the build succeeds.
