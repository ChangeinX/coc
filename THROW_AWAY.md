**Clans in *Clash of Clans* face a small set of recurring headaches—inactive or unco-operative members, lopsided donations, last-minute war chaos, recruitment hurdles since Global Chat was retired, leadership black-holes, and limited in-game analytics. By wrapping Clan life in a lightweight, installable Progressive Web App (PWA) that talks to Supercell’s public API, leaders can automate the dull admin, surface real-time data, and nudge players at exactly the right moment with push notifications. The result is fewer kicks, better wars, and a healthier community ecosystem.**

## Common pain-points for Clan leaders

| Theme                                                   | What players report                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inactive members & leader gaps**                      | Threads ask how soon to demote or kick idle players and lament leaders who vanish for 60 days until Supercell’s automatic rotation kicks in ([Reddit][1], [Supercell Support Portal][2]) |
| **Donation imbalance (“3 people donate 30 k troops…”)** | High-volume donors feel exploited and gem costs deter others from pitching in ([Reddit][3])                                                                                              |
| **War / Raid Weekend coordination**                     | Low participation, missed attacks, and alt-account abuse drain Clan Capital raid slots and war stars ([Reddit][4], [Reddit][5])                                                          |
| **Recruitment after Global Chat removal**               | Leaders struggle to find reliable players since the chat channel was shut down over moderation issues ([Reddit][6])                                                                      |
| **Toxicity & child-account filters**                    | Swearing suddenly censors the whole chat when a “child account” joins, forcing trial-and-error kicks ([Reddit][7])                                                                       |
| **Data blindness**                                      | Leaders rely on screenshots or third-party sites like Clash of Stats to track hit rates and donations ([clashofstats.com][8])                                                            |
| **Communication friction**                              | External Discord/WhatsApp groups are still recommended for strategic discussion ([Two Average Gamers][9])                                                                                |

## Why a Progressive Web App?

* **Install once, works everywhere** – A PWA ships in the browser but can be “added to Home Screen”, giving a near-native feel without App-Store friction ([Charter Global][10]).
* **Rich push notifications** – 77 % of users interact with at least one push per month and rich pushes lift open-rates by 56 % ([MobiLoud][11]).
* **Offline playbooks** – Service-worker caching keeps war bases, attack plans, and FAQs available on airplanes or spotty Wi-Fi ([PixelFreeStudio Blog -][12]).
* **Mature examples** – From Tinder Online to Uber, 2024’s marquee PWAs show how engagement climbs while bundle size shrinks ([onilab.com][13]).

## Feature map – How the PWA tackles each problem

### 1 . Activity Radar

*Pull clan and player timestamps from the official CoC API* ([Clash of Clans API][14]), flag anyone inactive > 3 days, and send a quiet reminder before leaders act. Automatic leader-rotation countdowns surface in-app.

### 2 . Donation Ledger

Real-time bar showing **troops given vs. received** plus season totals. A configurable “fair-share” threshold triggers push nudges to low donors, easing donor burnout ([Reddit][3]).

### 3 . War & Raid Command Center

* Sign-up toggle with deadline countdowns.
* Auto-DM attack targets when battle day starts.
* Raid-slot monitor blocking re-joins after leaving—fixes the alt-spam issue ([Reddit][5]).
* Offline “war plan” cache so strats remain visible even underground.

### 4 . Smart Recruitment Hub

*Public landing page* exposing Clan rules, recent war log, and donation ratios (pulled via API + Clash of Stats) so prospects self-filter. Shareable link substitutes the lost Global Chat funnel ([Reddit][6]).

### 5 . Moderated Chat Overlay

Optional profanity filter and automated “child-account detected” alert so elders know why censorship flips on ([Reddit][7]). Integrates voice links (e.g., Discord) but keeps core chat in-PWA.

### 6 . Analytics Dashboard

Charts for war hit-rate, average stars, raid loot, season-over-season retention—no more manual spreadsheets ([clashofstats.com][8]).

## Technical sketch & roll-out

1. **MVP (4 weeks)**

   * React/Vite front-end, Workbox service-worker, Supabase/Firestore backend.
   * OAuth via Supercell ID or token exchange to respect ToS.
   * Activity Radar + basic push.

2. **Beta (8 weeks)**

   * Donation Ledger, War Command Center, recruitment pages.
   * Add IndexedDB layer for offline war plans.

3. **v1 Launch (12 weeks)**

   * Role-based chat, clan-branding themes, deep-link share to invite code.
   * Lighthouse PWA audit ≥ 90 scores.

---

## Risks & mitigations

* **API rate limits** – Cache clan snapshots; poll every 5 min in war windows only.
* **User opt-in to pushes** – Educate users on benefits; schedule batches to avoid the 46 % opt-out cliff ([MobiLoud][11]).
* **Security** – Strict CSP, XSS sanitizers, token revocation—aligns with PWA security guidelines ([Charter Global][10]).

### Bottom line

By packaging real-time data, gentle nudges, and modern web tech into a single PWA, Clan leaders can swap ad-hoc spreadsheets and Discord pings for an always-on command deck. That means fewer surprise no-shows, fairer troop sharing, smoother wars—and ultimately, happier Chiefs.
